\subsubsection*{\underline{General purpose}}
To introduce myself (as a Math PhD student) to the class
\subsubsection*{\underline{Specific purpose}}
To help the audience understand some culture of the Math PhD students
\subsubsection*{\underline{Thesis statement}} 
Being a Math PhD student, I have some unique experience that other people don't have
% Math PhD students is an unique species that possesses unique behaviors. 
\subsubsection*{\underline{3 Main points}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Math PhD students over-consume coffee daily
% Math PhD students over-consume coffee daily and excuse themselves with the saying ``A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems" by the famous Hungarian mathematician Paul Erd\"os. 
% see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s
\item Math PhD students spend most of their productive time doing things seemingly trivial
% The work a Math PhD student has to do for their research includes reading, sketching on chalkboard or paper, and discussing with collaborators. Nothing is physically built except the magnificent theorems castle in our heads
\item Many people have misunderstanding to Math or mathematicians
% Math PhD students are very frequently told ``I hate Math so much!" and we normally don't know how to respond to that
