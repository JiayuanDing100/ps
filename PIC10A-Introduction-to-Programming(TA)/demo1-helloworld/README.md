## Sidenotes
1. to Xcode users - Xcode will print everything correctly until the very last end of the line (\n). So make sure you have at least one \n at the very end of everything you want to print.
2. to Sublime Text users - Sublime Text doesn't support user input in their built-in console. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11599066/sublime-text-with-console-input-for-c-programs
3. to Visual Studio users (which SHOULD BE EVERYONE) - you will find this helpful
