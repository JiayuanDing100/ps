## In class challenge

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) characters. (You can read its [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) if interested.)

Here's some sample ASCII art for cars:
```
                   _________________
           .--H--.|             jgs |
         _//_||  ||                 |
        [    -|  |'--;--------------'
        '-()-()----()"()^^^^^^^()"()'
```
```
                          ___
               .--.      [ATM]
          .----'   '--.    |
          '-()-----()-'    |
```
```
                   .---;-,
                __/_,{)|__;._                 
             ."` _     :  _  `.  .:::;.    .::'
         jgs '--(_)------(_)--' `      '::'
```
