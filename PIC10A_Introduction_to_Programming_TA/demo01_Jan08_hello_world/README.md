# Demo 1 - hello world

Brief intro to the 'hello, world!' program. 
* Comment `//`
* Testing the `cout << "Hello, world!\n";` line

## In class challenge
print "Hello world! \\(^_^)/" in the console. Here are some [hints](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1650981/how-do-you-output-the-symbol-using-cout).

## Memo
* Bring your laptop to class
* Run your program in Visual Studio before submitting homework assignments!
* Try [C++ shell](http://cpp.sh) for a quick test on the hello world program (without navigating through creating projects in Visual Studio)

## Side notes
* to Xcode users - Xcode will print everything correctly until the very last end of the line (\n). So make sure you have at least one \n at the very end of everything you want to print.
* to Sublime Text users - Sublime Text doesn't support user input in their built-in console. See [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11599066/sublime-text-with-console-input-for-c-programs)
* to Visual Studio users (which SHOULD BE EVERYONE) - you will find [this](http://www.pic.ucla.edu/getting-started-with-microsoft-visual-studio-2012/) helpful
