## Suggested Readings
* **LONG:** [template parameters and template arguments](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/template_parameters) 
* [function pointer](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/function-pointers.html) (read the nice summary at the end)
* [stack/heap memory allocation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10157122/object-creation-on-the-stack-heap)
* [pure virtual functions and abstract classes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pure-virtual-functions-and-abstract-classes/) (Note: you can't instantiate object of a abstract class type.)
* [defult container of std::stack is std:deque](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/102459/why-does-stdstack-use-stddeque-by-default)
* [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) (Note: **I was wrong in my previous discussion!!** Git takes snapshots of your filesystem instead of just storing the deltas!!!)
* [succinct intro to class accessors and inheritance](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/stdexcept) (read the second response)
* **LONG:** [partial template specialization](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/partial_specialization)


## Interesting Nuances
* [hash_set v.s. unordered_set](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7623328/stdhash-set-vs-stdunordered-set-are-they-the-same-thing)
* [map v.s. multimap (performance)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14932007/map-vs-multimap-in-c-performance)
* [unfreed memory after program execution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/654754/what-really-happens-when-you-dont-free-after-malloc)
* [exception categories](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/stdexcept)
* **LONG:** [runtime data structure](http://www.tenouk.com/ModuleW.html) (can jump to Table w.5)
* take a look at testCopy.cpp in this folder. Try commenting out the copy constructor. What do you see?
